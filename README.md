# 1001monkeys
A small web application where users band together to write 'books' by inputting submissions, and then collectively voting on the next submission to be added to the book. The name comes from the idea of monkeys at a typewriter theoretically being capable of typing things like the Declaration of Independence by pure chance.

It's written largely in React for the front end, and the backend is a combination of Node.JS + Express and Socket.io that interacts with a MySQL server hosted on my Amazon EC2 server!

Thanks for checking out this repository!
